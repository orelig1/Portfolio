# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About Me

Hi my name is Aur√©lie and I am bilingual (FR/EN) junior game developer. I also have experience in front-end development which has refined my organizational skills and attention to detail. I use my skills in C# and Unity to create immersive, user-friendly and interactive game experiences. Using my problem-solving abilities, I aim to make games accessible by providing intuitive, engaging gameplay. In my free time I enjoy playing games like League of Legends, World of Warcraft and Fae Farm.
