# Welcome to My Portfolio

## About Me

Hi, I'm Aurélie, a developer with a strong passion for game development. I recently completed an AEC Programmer/Analyst program at LaSalle College, where I gained experience in various languages, including C#, Java, and JavaScript. I currently work as a Front-End Developer at LCG Solution, but my focus is shifting toward game development, and I’m set to continue my education at McGill University in 2025, pursuing a Game Development Bootcamp. I’ve worked on multiple personal and academic projects using Unity and C#, and I’m eager to continue building immersive game systems.
